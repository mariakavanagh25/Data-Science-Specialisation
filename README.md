# Project Objective

1. Write an R scrpit called <b> run_analysis.R </b> , that does the follwoing: 
    - Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    - Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    - Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    - Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    - From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
 
2. Provide link to <b> Github repository </b> with your script for performing the analysis
3. Provide CodeBook, called <b> CodeBook.md </b> that describes: 
    - the variables, 
    - the data, 
    - any transformations you performed 
4. Provide a <b> README.mf </b> file in the github repo that:
    - explains how all of the scripts work
    - how they are connected
